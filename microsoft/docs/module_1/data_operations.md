# Data operations

Data engineering involves the following main tasks:
- **Data integration**
    - involves establishing links between operational and analytical services and data sources to enable secure, reliable access to data across multiple systems
- **Data transformation**
    - operational data usually needs to be transformed into suitable structure and format for analysis, often as part of an extract, transform, and load process (ETL)
- **Data consolidation**
    - it is the process of combining data that has been extracted from multiple data sources into a consistent structure usually to support analytics and reporting
