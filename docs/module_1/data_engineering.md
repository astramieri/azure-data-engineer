# What is data engineering

The data engineer will often work with multiple types of data to perform many operations using many scripting or coding languages that are appropriate to their individual organization.

## Types of data

There are three primary types of data that a data engineer will work with:
- structured
- semi-structured
- unstructured

## Data operations

As a data engineer some of the main tasks that you'll perform in Azure include:
- **data integration**: involves establishing links between operational and analytical services and data sources to enable secure, reliable access to data across multiple systems.
- **data transformation**: operational data usually needs to be transformed into suitable structure and format for analysis, often as part of an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process
- **data consolidation**: it is the process of combining data that has been extracted from multiple data sources into a consistent structure usually to support analytics and reporting
