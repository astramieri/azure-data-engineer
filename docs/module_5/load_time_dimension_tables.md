# Load time dimension tables

Time dimension tables store a record for each time interval based on the grain by which you want to aggregate data over time. For example, a time dimension table at the date grain contains a record for each date between the earliest and latest dates referenced by the data in related fact tables.

The following code example shows how you can generate a sequence of time dimension values based on a date grain. As the data warehouse is populated in the future with new fact data, you periodically need to extend the range of dates related time dimension tables.

    -- Create a temporary table for the dates we need
    CREATE TABLE #TmpStageDate (DateVal DATE NOT NULL)

    -- Populate the temp table with a range of dates
    DECLARE @StartDate DATE
    DECLARE @EndDate DATE
    SET @StartDate = '2019-01-01'
    SET @EndDate = '2023-12-31'
    DECLARE @LoopDate = @StartDate
    WHILE @LoopDate <= @EndDate
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO #TmpStageDate VALUES
        (
            @LoopDate
        )
        SET @LoopDate = DATEADD(dd, 1, @LoopDate)
    END

    -- Insert the dates and calculated attributes into the dimension table
    INSERT INTO dbo.DimDate
    SELECT CAST(CONVERT(VARCHAR(8), DateVal, 112) as INT), -- date key
        DateVal, --date alt key
        Day(DateVal) -- day number of month
        ..
        --  other derived temporal fields as required
        ..
    FROM #TmpStageDate
    GO

    --Drop temporary table
    DROP TABLE #TmpStageDate
