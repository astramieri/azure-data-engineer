# Enable Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 in Azure Storage

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 isn't a standalone Azure service, but rather a configurable capability of a **StorageV2** (General Purpose V2) Azure Storage.

To enable Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 in an Azure Storage account, you can select the option to **Enable hierarchical namespace** in the **Advanced** page when creating the storage account in the Azure portal.

Alternatively, if you already have an Azure Storage account and want to enable the Azure data Lake Storage Gen2 capability, you can use the **Data Lake Gen2 upgrade wizard** in the Azure portal page for your storage account resource.
