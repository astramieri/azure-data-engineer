# What is Azure Synapse Analytics

The technological research and consulting firm Gartner defines four common types of analytical technique that organizations commonly use:
- **Descriptive analytics**
    - “What is happening in my business?”
    - The data to answer this question is typically answered through the creation of a data warehouse in which historical data is persisted in relational tables for multidimensional modeling and reporting.
- **Diagnostic analytics**
    - “Why is it happening?”
    - This may involve exploring information that already exists in a data warehouse, but typically involves a wider search of your data estate to find more data to support this type of analysis.
- **Predictive analytics**
    - “What is likely to happen in the future based on previous trends and patterns?”
- **Prescriptive analytics**
    - This enables autonomous decision making based on real-time or near real-time analysis of data, using predictive analytics.

## Azure Synapse Analytics

**Azure Synapse Analytics** provides a cloud platform for all of these analytical workloads through support for multiple data storage, processing, and analysis technologies in a single, integrated solution. 

The integrated design of Azure Synapse Analytics enables organizations to leverage investments and skills in multiple commonly used data technologies, including SQL, Apache Spark, and others; while providing a centrally managed service and a single, consistent user interface.
